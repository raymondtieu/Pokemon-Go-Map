# Pokemon-Go-Map

A Pokemon Go Map scanning application written using the Ionic v2 (beta) framework. Documentation on Ionic v2 can be found [here] (http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/tutorial/).

This scanning component no longer works due to Niantic blocking hosting sites trying to access to their APIs. This application was receiving data from a Flask server I wrote and deployed onto Heroku.

To install:
* clone respository 
* `cd` to the download location run `npm install`
* after installation, run `ionic serve` and this should run the server locally

or install the apk from releases
